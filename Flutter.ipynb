    "- Apple's iOS SDK was released in 2008. (Objective-C, now Swift)\n",
    "- Google's Android SDK was released in 2009. (Java)\n",
    "- These apps talked to the specific platform to create platform-specific widgets or access services. \n",

    "- But it is difficult for languages like JavaScript to talk directly to native code (like the services) so they go through a “bridge” that does context switches between the JavaScript realm and the native realm. \n",
    "- Now we have Flutter, thanks to Google.\n",
    "- Flutter started as an experiment performed by members of the Chrome browser team at Google. \n",
    "- On December 4, 2018, Flutter 1.0 was released. \n",

    "- Reactive style views\n",
    "- Avoids javascript performance bridge problems by uising a compiled programming language called Dart\n",
    "- Dart is compiled ahead of time into native code for multiple platforms\n",
    "- Compiling ot native code improves app startup times\n",
    "- It also heavily uses 'widgets'\n",
    "- Widgets are elements that affect and control th eview and interface to an app\n",

    "- Widgets should be Beautiful Performant Extensible and Customizable. So Flutter made its own widgets\n",
    "- Everything is a widget!\n",
    "- In Flutter, centering and padding are widgets. Themes are widgets, which apply to their children. And even applications and navigation are widgets.\n",

    "- Layouts can be confusing in mobile apps. So Instead of having a large set of layout rules that could be applied to any widget, each widget would specify its own simple layout model.\n",
    "- Because each widget has a much smaller set of layout rules to consider, layout can be optimized heavily.\n",
