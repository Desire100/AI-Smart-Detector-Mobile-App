# Smart-Detector-Mobile-App (SmaDet)

## Overview

This repo contains the steps on how to built an mobile application for object detection powered with [YOLOv2] [YOLOv2](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolov2/).

### Demo

[smadet.zip](https://github.com/Desire100/Smart-Detector-Mobile-App-Powered-by-AI/files/4082932/smadet.zip) This is 
the short video about the functionality of the app.


### Tools Used



**[Flutter](https://github.com/Desire100/Smart-Detector-Mobile-App-Powered-by-AI/blob/master/Flutter.ipynb)**: is Googleâ€™s portable UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively-compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. 



**TensorFlow Lite**: is a set of tools to help developers run TensorFlow models on mobile, embedded, and IoT devices. It enables on-device machine learning inference with low latency and a small binary size.

## Instructions

First install [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). 

After download, from command line run this to install the dependencies
```
flutter packages get
```
Then run this command to run the app

```
flutter run
```
Alternatively you can open the app as a new flutter project in Android Studio after installing the Flutter plugin. 

## Wait what's YOLOv2?
You only look once (YOLO) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. On a Titan X it processes images at 40-90 FPS and has a mAP on VOC 2007 of 78.6% and a mAP of 48.1% on COCO test-dev.

[this](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolov2/) is YOLOv2.
